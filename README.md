# Work-Day-Scheduler

This is our fifth homework assignment in nu-chi-fsf-ft-03-2021-u-c! 

In this excercise, we were tasked with creating a scheduler with time based interactivity. The hour sections change color based on time of day and can create and save tasks/whatever is entered into each bar.

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

This was definitely a tough one. getting the bars to change color with the time threw me some loops. It was fun to try and figure out though!

## Usage

With a working date/time clock in the header, you can add tasks or whatever you wish to each box and save them in place. As the day goes on, the hour that is current is changed to a red background, hours behind are grey and hours yet to come are green.
